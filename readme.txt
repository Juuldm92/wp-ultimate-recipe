WP Ultimate Recipe is a user friendly plugin for adding recipes to any of your posts and pages.

== Description ==

WP Ultimate Recipe is a user friendly plugin for adding recipes to any of your posts and pages.

Some features:

*   Use shortcodes or the "Insert Recipe" button to add **multiple recipes to any of your posts and pages**.
*   Ingredients, course types, cuisines and ratings are all **taxonomies** related to your recipe. This means that you can display these in a nice tag cloud widget.
*   Add **photos** to any step of the recipe.
*   Just click the printer icon to **print an image-less version** of the recipe.
*   This plugin is **fully responsive**. That means that your recipes will look good on any device.
*   Uses microdata optimised for **Google Recipe search**.
*   Easily **translatable**, already available in English, Dutch and Swedish
*   Let visitors **adjust the ingredient quantities** for more or less servings
*   Add a **recipe index** to any post or page

We also have a [premium version](http://www.wpultimaterecipeplugin.com/#premium) which offers the following features:

*   Custom **styling** of recipes
*   Let your **users submit** recipes
*   User menus with a **shopping list generator**
