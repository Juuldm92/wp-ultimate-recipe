WP Ultimate Recipe is a user friendly plugin for adding recipes to any of your posts and pages.

== Description ==

[WP Ultimate Recipe](http://www.wpultimaterecipeplugin.com/) is a user friendly plugin for adding recipes to any of your posts and pages.

Some features:

*   Use shortcodes or the "Insert Recipe" button to add **multiple recipes to any of your posts and pages**.

*   This plugin is **fully responsive**. That means that your recipes will look good on any device.

*   Easily **translatable**, already available in English, Dutch, Swedish and many others
*   Let visitors **adjust the ingredient quantities** for more or less servings
*   Add a **recipe index** to any post or page
*   Structure your ingredients and instructions in **groups** (e.g. icing and cake batter)
*   Visitors can **share your recipes**

We also have a [premium version](http://www.wpultimaterecipeplugin.com/#premium) which offers the following features:

*   Custom **styling** of recipes
*   Let your **users submit** recipes
*   User menus with a **shopping list generator**
*   Create **custom tags** for your recipes
*   Advanced **recipe index** features
*   Nice **recipe grid** to show and filter your recipes
*   **Import ReciPress** recipes
*   Custom **ingredient links** (great for affiliate marketing)
*   Let your **users rate your recipes**
*   Advanced usage of **WP categories and tags**
